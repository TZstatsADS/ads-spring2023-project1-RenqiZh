# ADS Project 1: R Notebook on the history of philosophy

### Data folder

The data directory contains data used in the analysis. This is treated as read only; in paricular the R/python files are never allowed to write to the files in here. Depending on the project, these might be csv files, a database, and the directory itself may have subdirectories.

Due to large volume of the data set, I am not able to upload the data set onto github. The link to the data set is here:
